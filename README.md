# Movie Trailer Website
This project is to use Object Oriented Python to create a Movie Trailer Website. 

This webpage is created dynamically by Python code 

To run the program, you can check out this repo by 

```
git clone https://github.com/willthink/ud036_StarterCode.git 

cd ud036_StarterCode

python entertainment_center.py 

```

A web page should be opened in your web browser which contains six movie poster images. By clicking any of them, a youtube popup should show up to present the trailer of that movie.
